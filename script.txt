THE OFFER (EXPLAIN LIKE THIS)

“We run targeted SMS campaigns to homeowners in your service area — usually within a 15–20 mile radius. We ask homeowners whether they need roof repairs, replacements, or storm damage checks. If they show interest, we qualify them and send you the homeowner details. You only pay for qualified leads, which are $90 each. There’s a $600 monthly retainer that covers software, data, SMS tools, and everything on our end.”

Key points:

Homeowners are from their exact service area

Leads are exclusive

They pay only for qualified leads

Retainer covers tools + software

No long-term contract (month-to-month)

CALL FLOW STRUCTURE

OPENER

“Hey, is this the owner?
Great — this is {{your_name}} calling from a marketing agency. We help roofing companies get exclusive homeowner leads without relying on HomeAdvisor or shared platforms.”

SHORT VALUE PITCH

“We use SMS outreach to connect with homeowners in your service area who need roof repair or replacement. You only pay for qualified leads at $90, plus a $600 retainer for the software.”


---

QUALIFICATION QUESTIONS (ASK NATURALLY)

Ask only if they are interested:

1. “Which areas or ZIP codes do you usually serve?”


2. “Do you prefer repair jobs, replacement jobs, or both?”


3. “How soon can you take on new clients?”


4. “Do you handle insurance-related storm damage jobs?”



These help tailor the offer.

OBJECTION HANDLING (FULL VERSION)

1. “It’s too expensive.”

“I hear you. Most roofers feel that way at first. But because you only pay for qualified leads, the ROI is strong — even closing one job usually covers the entire month.”


---

2. “We already have marketing.”

“That’s great — this doesn’t replace anything. It just adds exclusive, local homeowner leads on top of what you're already doing.”


---

3. “We don’t trust SMS.”

“Totally understand. The thing is — homeowners respond to SMS faster than calls or emails. It’s non-intrusive and gives you higher reply rates.”


---

4. “Send me info.”

“For sure. Before I send anything, it’s better to give you a quick 5-minute explanation so you can see exactly how leads are qualified. When works better, later today or tomorrow?”


---

5. “We get too many unqualified leads.”

“That’s exactly why our system is different. You pay only for qualified interest — we filter out renters, tire kickers, and people outside your area.”


---

6. “We tried agencies before.”

“Totally get it. Our model is different — no contracts, no upfront packages, and no paying for junk leads.”


---

7. “We’re too busy.”

“No worries. Even a 5-minute call can show you if this can increase your deal flow without adding work for you.”


---

8. “I’m not interested.”

“Totally fine. Before I hop off — are you currently taking on new roofing jobs, or is your schedule full?”

(Optionally revive the conversation.)


---

CLOSING THE CALL (THE GOAL)

Your #1 aim:

Book a 5–10 minute demo with the owner.

Say:

“Let’s set up a quick 5–10 minute call so I can show you how many homeowners in your exact area are responding. What time works better — today or tomorrow?”

If they refuse:

“Totally fine. I’ll send a brief overview to your number. If anything changes or if you want a few exclusive leads to test, just message me.”
